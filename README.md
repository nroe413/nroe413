# Hi I'm Nate! 👋

I am interested in programming problems related to residential heating and cooling in the context of U.S. decarbonization. 

I'm currently working on research in [Dr. Erin Mayfield's Group](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/people/erin-mayfield) at Dartmouth and working as an Analyst at the NorthBridge Group.

Cheers! 🍻
